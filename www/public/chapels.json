Born at Palomar Hospital in Escondido and was raised in San Marcos in the home my parents still live in. How\u0026rsquo;s that for old school? I went to Alvin Dunn Elementary, San Marcos Junior High and graduated from San Marcos High School (1984). It was the summer between high school and college that my life would change forever.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;I had just graduated High School, turned 18, and was living life\u0026hellip;at least I was doing what I thought was living! I was playing baseball every day and doing what young people often do. In the summer of \u0026rsquo;84, I was about to grow up real fast as my promiscuous lifestyle caught up with me. There was a knock on the door, an announcement that she was pregnant, and then a decision to have an abortion. My thoughtless, selfish actions led to some soul searching as a freshman at Palomar Community College in San Marcos. I had hurt someone, taken the life of a child and I was plagued by a series of questions I simply could not find answers to on my own. Questions like\u0026hellip; What really is the value of life? How do I find satisfaction? What have I done? Can I be forgiven?\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003E\r\n\u003Cbr /\u003E\r\nThe search for truth, significance, and forgiveness eventually led me to Jesus. I had experimented with drugs and drinking. The abortion was further evidence I had been irresponsible with my life and body. I had been searching for answers when someone gave me a Bible to read. After a couple months of reading the Bible and asking people questions about what it said and what it meant, I came to place of believing that maybe God could heal the depths of my pain. I still had unanswered questions about God, Christianity, and the church, but I knew I needed help. The way I was living was not the way to live at all, so in May of 1985 in the Palomar College cafeteria, I surrendered my life to Jesus. That afternoon, I prayed a very simple prayer: \u0026ldquo;\u003Cem\u003EGod if you are real, here\u0026rsquo;s my life\u003C/em\u003E.\u0026rdquo; At that time, I wasn\u0026#39;t completely sure who He was, but I knew I had tried everything else and was still lost. My prayer wasn\u0026rsquo;t long or very spiritual, but it was genuine. It was then my journey would change forever and for the better.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the next couple years, I was a student, a college baseball player, and a regular reader of the Bible. I started to attend church and learned that God was not only real, but that He had a plan for my life. I had experienced forgiveness for my sins and grace from those I had hurt. I was ready to make a new commitment to God. I was already His child. God had saved me and given me life. My questions were being answered and my faith was growing. After spending a couple of years learning to walk with Jesus, I prayed yet another prayer that would change my life. God was indeed real. I wanted to help others discover new life, forgiveness, and healing just as I had. So I prayed, \u0026ldquo;\u003Cem\u003EGod if you can use me, I am willing to be your servant wherever you want to send me to do whatever you\u0026rsquo;d like me to do\u003C/em\u003E.\u0026rdquo; This was the least I could do after what Jesus had done for me.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWith a new commitment to serve God, I changed my major to Spanish and transferred from Palomar to San Diego State. Two knee surgeries and God\u0026rsquo;s greater design for my life brought my dream of playing baseball to an end. My new dream was to learn a new language, to minister to my Hispanic family members, and to eventually be a missionary. My path led me to spend a year as a foreign exchange student in Mexico City. My time in Mexico confirmed in me the desire to spend the rest of my life helping others find the peace with God that I had come to enjoy.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EUpon returning to the United States in 1989 with a B.A. in Spanish, I started my formal ministry training at Talbot School of Theology at Biola University in La Mirada, California. I spent the next eight years working part-time at Emmanuel Faith Community Church in Escondido, CA as an intern and driving to Talbot. During these years, God laid a foundation in my life of what it meant to follow Him while I learned to serve His people.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of my intern assignments was to serve in the single\u0026rsquo;s ministry of the church.

In June of 1999 I took the position of church planter for the new church start-up Emmanuel Faith wanted to begin in San Marcos. This new church would eventually be called Mission Hills Church. We officially opened with our first service in the gym at Emmanuel Faith in October of 1999. Our San Marcos campus opened up in March of 2007. It is difficult to believe sometimes that what started as a Bible study of 30 people has grown to a church with multiple worship services and over 1400 people. Aside from knowing Jesus, this has been the most exciting adventure Sheevaun and I have ever traveled.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe God story is an amazing one to be a part of.

Woo, Strategic, Learner, Communication, Connectedness.\u000B\u000B1. What do you do in your job (briefly)?  Oversee Residence Life.  Manage and care for the RDs.  Work with Student Care.  Have lots of meetings.  Work on policies and procedures for ResLife.\u000B\u000B2. The five (or so) most influential books you've read:\u000B\u000BLiving Above the Level of Mediocrity by Charles Swindoll\u000BThe Four Loves by CS Lewis\u000BHearing God by Peter Lord\u000BTill We Have Faces by CS Lewis\u000BChristy by Catherine Marshall\u000B3. An influential person in your life/hero/best example of love?  I would have to say that my family have all taken turns being great examples of love.  They have saved me, humbled me, loved me, and corrected me.\u000B\u000B4. Why are you at Biola? I believe in Biola.  I love the mission of equipping students in both mind and character to impact the world for Jesus.  That is something I can put my whole self behind.  \u000B\u000B5. A guilty pleasure: Ben \u0026 Jerry\u2019s Phish Food, Cheap shoes\u000B\u000B6. Can you share your testimony in 200 words or less? I was converted at the age of 5 when I prayed and asked Jesus into my heart. I did this with both of my parents. However, I believe my rededication at the age of 13 was more significant in my ownership of my relationship with Christ. I felt convicted at winter camp and submitted again to being a follower of Jesus. I am so grateful I was separated from my friends (for talking) during the session \u2013 so I would listen and hear both the speaker and ultimately the Holy Spirit. I believe this was a critical point in my life and that God intervened at a time when I needed to be grounded before entering high school. It has made all the difference.\u000B\u000B7. If God put you completely in charge of creating Heaven, what would it be like? Well, I am simply not as creative as our God. So, I would probably just copy him or have something like 2 Yosemites. There would be a lot of outdoor areas - green fields that go on for miles. We would have lots of time to walk and talk with people. Enjoy being, listening. Honestly \u2013 I will happily settle with the earth and humans restored to Eden, without our groaning. I am overwhelmed at that thought.\u000B\u000B8. What movie/TV/book have you seen in the last year that you wish all your friends could see? A book you would insist your children read? The Shack really impacted me. Controversy or not, there is a lot of truth about God that made me feel humbled and cared for deeply. As far as my children go \u2013 I want to raise them on Little House on the Prairie \u2013 I think the truths and principles there are awesome. Cheesy some say, but I don\u2019t care \u2013 I love it!\u000B\u000B9. If you could relive any part of your life, what part would it be, and why? I\u2019m not sure I would. There is pain I would avoid or lessons I wish I learned quicker. But, I think the process is where we are truly formed.  So, I\u2019ll take it all \u2013 the good and the bad.  God redeems.\u000B\u000B10. What is the most difficult choice you\u2019ve ever had to make? What made it difficult? What factors helped you make that choice? I think moving away from my family and friends to go to Philadelphia.  I wanted to live in another part of the country, work and go to school.  I thought it would be a fun risk and change of pace.  But, I was scared of the unknown and even more scared of the loneliness I knew I would face.  I think I was able to make the choice because people supported me. And, I knew it was a good risk to take.  \u000B\u000B11. What is the most risky thing you want to try doing? I think I would go live in a foreign country for awhile.  I imagine myself in Costa Rica or something like that \u2013 living with the people and learning the language.  I really would like to be fluent in Spanish. \u000B\u000B12. What are five things you are most thankful for in your life right now?\u000B\u000BMy husband,Todd.\u000BMy girlfriends who listen to me and support me.\u000BThe movement and comfort of the Spirit in my soul.\u000BMy home off campus.  \u000BMy ipod.\u000B13. In difficult times, who would you most want praying for you? I would take anyone who is earnest and loves God.  I would want someone who loves me too.  I suppose someone who is righteous \u2013 since their prayer \u201cavaileth much\u201d.  \u000B\u000B14. What was the greatest peer pressure you felt as a teen/college student? I think it must have been in high school.  I think the pressure to figure out what choices to make morally and sexually.\u000B\u000B15. Do you think it is possible to live with no regrets? No.  I think we are sinful and fallen.  I think mistakes are a necessary part of life.  If we try to live with no regrets (which was my motto for awhile), I think we tend to try to perfect our lives without God.  So, I don\u2019t say that is my goal anymore.  \u000B\u000B16. What is your definition of success? Do you consider yourself to be successful? I think knowing God and honoring Him above all is success.  Then, I think it is giving and receiving love from others.  I would also say that it is living fully in who God has called us to be \u2013 going where we think He is leading and changing when He changes the message.  In some regard, I think I am successful.  But, it others ways, I am totally aware of selfishness, self-protection and fear that keep me from living boldy and trusting God\u2019s voice.\u000B\u000B17. How much is your self-worth and identity determined by your job and your success at it? Honestly, I don\u2019t know.  Sometimes I think it is in its right place.  Other times, I care a great deal about doing really well and not letting anyone down.  I am still trying to figure out what it looks like to want to do well, pour yourself into something, and only take from it what is good.  I think it is a lifelong journey.\u000B\u000B18. What are the most important things you look for when choosing a church? If people seem to be alive and in honest, authentic and loving relationships.  I also look for sound biblical teaching.  Like anyone, I prefer the worship I prefer.  But, I think that comes and goes and we can train ourselves to worship even in a poorly done service.  So ultimately, love and teaching are the essentials to me.\u000B\u000B19. What is the most beautiful thing you have ever seen? That is hard.  I think I am going to choose something between entering the Yosemite Valley, looking out the window of a plane and seeing the sunset with a layer of clouds below you, and lastly looking at one of my nieces or nephews at birth.\u000B\u000B20. What are the 3 questions you most want to ask God?\u000B\u000BWhy did you allow Satan to rebel?\u000BWhy did you choose me and not someone else \u2013 I can\u2019t comprehend what you meant by only choosing some of us.\u000BWhen did you really intervene in my life to protect me or save me and I didn\u2019t have any clue?\u000B21. In what areas of your life is it most difficult to trust God? My future and the unknown.  It is sooo hard to believe at these moments that He will do good to me and that I will be able to handle whatever comes.  I often doubt both He and myself in our ability to handle what is unknown.\u000B\u000B22. What does contentment mean to you? How close are you to that, now? Contentment seems to be gratitiude and acceptance of your circumstances.  I think it is very difficult to accept from God\u2019s hand what is happening in our internal and external worlds.  I like to fix and problem solve \u2013 so I think contentment looks a little less active and compulsive than I am sometimes.  How close?  Well, I can say that I am closer than I have been in several years.  What I do know is that I prefer contentment \u2013 it is easier to walk with a settled heart rather than one that is fighting.  But, it take surrender to walk with that type of a heart."}}],"series":[],"location":{"name":"Chase Gymnasium"}},

That\u0026rsquo;s really magical.\u0026quot;\u000B\u000BSteve Bell has a fascinating life story. He first learned to play guitar in a maximum security penitentiary in Alberta! Steve picks up the story, \u0026quot;My father was the chaplain at the Drumheller Prison. Some of the inmates were high-flying guitar pickers in the Chet Atkins style. They\u0026rsquo;d ask my dad if they could have jam sessions in the chapel on Saturday afternoons, and he got the guards to stay away. This was the only place these inmates could go without (the threat of) penal security. They\u0026rsquo;d sit in a circle and have these bluegrass jams. One time, my dad let me sit and watch and I was absolutely enthralled. When they realized I wanted to play they invited me to grab a guitar and sit in. They treated me like a real peer, so not only did they teach me guitar, but this was the first circle of adult men not to treat me like a kid.\u0026quot; Looking back, Steve noted that, \u0026quot;The reason I tour the world now is because Canada\u0026rsquo;s most unwanted men invested in me when I was eight years old!\u0026quot;\u000B\u000BSteve\u0026rsquo;s passion for music had revealed itself even earlier, and he credits his mother\u0026rsquo;s influence; \u0026quot;My mum was a classical pianist, a tremendous player. At night she\u0026rsquo;d put us kids to bed, and then sit down at the piano till 2 or 3 am. I remember lying there being bathed in Gershwin and the classics and hymns. She suffered from depression, and there was a subtext of sorrow in her playing. Most beautiful things have that.\u0026quot;\u000B\u000BHis mother also played electric guitar; \u0026quot;When she was playing I\u0026rsquo;d watch her hands and memorize everywhere she put them. If she went to the garden I\u0026rsquo;d grab that thing for five minutes and try it. Eventually I was caught, but it worked out, as my parents bought me my first guitar.\u0026quot;\u000B\u000BSteve played the bar circuit around Winnipeg. His talent as a guitarist and vocalist were showcased in the trio Elias, Schritt and Bell, a group that found regional success. \u0026quot;I did that for about 10 years full-time, from 1978 to the late \u0026rsquo;80s,\u0026quot; he recalled; \u0026quot;I was jobbing. I\u0026rsquo;d play in country bands, dance bands, rock bands, to keep the bills paid. I didn\u0026rsquo;t even really see myself as a musician. I saw it as kind of a stop-gap thing until I figured out what to do with myself.\u0026quot;\u000B\u000BPlaying the bars took its toll, Bell explained; \u0026quot;I got married and had kids and it started to wear thin. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t going anywhere. I then had something of a spiritual experience, and I felt God speak to me and say \u0026lsquo;this time in your life is over.\u0026rsquo; I just upped and quit, and I stayed home with the kids while my wife Nanci went back to teaching. I really felt I was hanging up my guitar.\u0026quot;\u000B\u000BTime to reflect upon his life and explore his faith enabled Bell to become a songwriter. \u0026quot;Music just started pouring out of me. Those first six months at home it was like a fire hose, a period of creativity I\u0026rsquo;ve never had since, or before. Every time I read something a song would come out. I\u0026rsquo;d go to church, hear a psalm and I\u0026rsquo;d write a song.\u0026quot;\u000B\u000BFamily friend Father Bob McDougall, the Catholic pastor at Stony Mountain Prison, \u0026quot;just showed up at my door, saying \u0026lsquo;you should do a Christian album\u0026rsquo;,\u0026quot; Bell recalled. \u0026quot;That hadn\u0026rsquo;t been on my radar at all. I thought I\u0026rsquo;d quit music. He insisted, saying he\u0026rsquo;d pay for it. I checked with my friend Dave Zeglinski, who is now my manager, we came up with a figure, and Father Bob paid for it. I just hoped I could sell or give away all 200 copies over the next five years!\u0026quot;\u000B\u000BIn fact, Steve\u0026rsquo;s 1989 debut album, Comfort My People, took off by word of mouth. Bell finally relented and returned to performing. \u0026quot;One pastor wouldn\u0026rsquo;t take no for an answer. I kept saying I was a failed bar musician, but he said \u0026lsquo;come and do three songs and I\u0026rsquo;ll pay you $200,\u0026rsquo; so I said yes.\u0026quot; Steve ended up playing a full set for the congregation at a Mennonite community in southern Manitoba, and this proved a life-changing experience. \u0026quot;That\u0026rsquo;s where I saw the vision of it. You can just go up, tell an honest story, sing an honest song and go home. That is a good way to spend a night. Things took off from there. I learned to trust my instincts onstage, I started storytelling, albums started selling, and I got more calls for concerts. It grew very organically.\u0026quot;\u000B\u000BNow, 20 years later, Bell is still telling stories and singing songs. He cites the singer/songwriters of the \u0026rsquo;70s as key influences on his music, noting, \u0026quot;I grew up on people like Bruce Cockburn, Kenny Loggins, Dan Fogelberg, James Taylor and Crosby Stills and Nash.\u0026quot;\u000B\u000BAmidst his intensive North American touring schedule, Bell has always found time to work on behalf of such worthy organizations as World Vision, Compassion Canada, and Canadian Foodgrains Bank, and his advocacy efforts have been worth millions to these causes. He has also traveled extensively in the third world, spreading hope via his music and message to communities in India, Thailand, Bangladesh, the Philippines, Ethiopia, Palestine, Kenya, Guatemala, and many other countries.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n"}},

You realize what a service you\u0026rsquo;re offering people. They can imagine a different universe or you give them respite from their daily life. You can make them laugh or cry, and they can make emotional connections they would not on their own. It is a real social offering to make and when you\u0026rsquo;re onstage you can just see it happening to people right in front of your eyes. That\u0026rsquo;s really magical.\u0026quot;\u000B\u000BSteve Bell has a fascinating life story. He first learned to play guitar in a maximum security penitentiary in Alberta! Steve picks up the story, \u0026quot;My father was the chaplain at the Drumheller Prison. Some of the inmates were high-flying guitar pickers in the Chet Atkins style. They\u0026rsquo;d ask my dad if they could have jam sessions in the chapel on Saturday afternoons, and he got the guards to stay away. This was the only place these inmates could go without (the threat of) penal security. They\u0026rsquo;d sit in a circle and have these bluegrass jams. One time, my dad let me sit and watch and I was absolutely enthralled. When they realized I wanted to play they invited me to grab a guitar and sit in. They treated me like a real peer, so not only did they teach me guitar, but this was the first circle of adult men not to treat me like a kid.\u0026quot; Looking back, Steve noted that, \u0026quot;The reason I tour the world now is because Canada\u0026rsquo;s most unwanted men invested in me when I was eight years old!\u0026quot;\u000B\u000BSteve\u0026rsquo;s passion for music had revealed itself even earlier, and he credits his mother\u0026rsquo;s influence; \u0026quot;My mum was a classical pianist, a tremendous player. At night she\u0026rsquo;d put us kids to bed, and then sit down at the piano till 2 or 3 am. I remember lying there being bathed in Gershwin and the classics and hymns. She suffered from depression, and there was a subtext of sorrow in her playing. Most beautiful things have that.\u0026quot;\u000B\u000BHis mother also played electric guitar; \u0026quot;When she was playing I\u0026rsquo;d watch her hands and memorize everywhere she put them. If she went to the garden I\u0026rsquo;d grab that thing for five minutes and try it. Eventually I was caught, but it worked out, as my parents bought me my first guitar.\u0026quot;\u000B\u000BSteve played the bar circuit around Winnipeg. His talent as a guitarist and vocalist were showcased in the trio Elias, Schritt and Bell, a group that found regional success. \u0026quot;I did that for about 10 years full-time, from 1978 to the late \u0026rsquo;80s,\u0026quot; he recalled; \u0026quot;I was jobbing. I\u0026rsquo;d play in country bands, dance bands, rock bands, to keep the bills paid. I didn\u0026rsquo;t even really see myself as a musician. I saw it as kind of a stop-gap thing until I figured out what to do with myself.\u0026quot;\u000B\u000BPlaying the bars took its toll, Bell explained; \u0026quot;I got married and had kids and it started to wear thin. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t going anywhere. I then had something of a spiritual experience, and I felt God speak to me and say \u0026lsquo;this time in your life is over.\u0026rsquo; I just upped and quit, and I stayed home with the kids while my wife Nanci went back to teaching. I really felt I was hanging up my guitar.\u0026quot;\u000B\u000BTime to reflect upon his life and explore his faith enabled Bell to become a songwriter. \u0026quot;Music just started pouring out of me. Those first six months at home it was like a fire hose, a period of creativity I\u0026rsquo;ve never had since, or before. Every time I read something a song would come out. I\u0026rsquo;d go to church, hear a psalm and I\u0026rsquo;d write a song.\u0026quot;\u000B\u000BFamily friend Father Bob McDougall, the Catholic pastor at Stony Mountain Prison, \u0026quot;just showed up at my door, saying \u0026lsquo;you should do a Christian album\u0026rsquo;,\u0026quot; Bell recalled. \u0026quot;That hadn\u0026rsquo;t been on my radar at all. I thought I\u0026rsquo;d quit music. He insisted, saying he\u0026rsquo;d pay for it. I checked with my friend Dave Zeglinski, who is now my manager, we came up with a figure, and Father Bob paid for it. I just hoped I could sell or give away all 200 copies over the next five years!\u0026quot;\u000B\u000BIn fact, Steve\u0026rsquo;s 1989 debut album, Comfort My People, took off by word of mouth. Bell finally relented and returned to performing. \u0026quot;One pastor wouldn\u0026rsquo;t take no for an answer. I kept saying I was a failed bar musician, but he said \u0026lsquo;come and do three songs and I\u0026rsquo;ll pay you $200,\u0026rsquo; so I said yes.\u0026quot; Steve ended up playing a full set for the congregation at a Mennonite community in southern Manitoba, and this proved a life-changing experience. \u0026quot;That\u0026rsquo;s where I saw the vision of it. You can just go up, tell an honest story, sing an honest song and go home. That is a good way to spend a night. Things took off from there. I learned to trust my instincts onstage, I started storytelling, albums started selling, and I got more calls for concerts. It grew very organically.\u0026quot;\u000B\u000BNow, 20 years later, Bell is still telling stories and singing songs. He cites the singer/songwriters of the \u0026rsquo;70s as key influences on his music, noting, \u0026quot;I grew up on people like Bruce Cockburn, Kenny Loggins, Dan Fogelberg, James Taylor and Crosby Stills and Nash.\u0026quot;\u000B\u000BAmidst his intensive North American touring schedule, Bell has always found time to work on behalf of such worthy organizations as World Vision, Compassion Canada, and Canadian Foodgrains Bank, and his advocacy efforts have been worth millions to these causes. He has also traveled extensively in the third world, spreading hope via his music and message to communities in India, Thailand, Bangladesh, the Philippines, Ethiopia, Palestine, Kenya, Guatemala, and many other countries.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n"}},
